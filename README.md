# Twitter Bot Detection
## Final Project for CSCI-109A
**Fall 2018**

Our research goal was to build a model to answer the question - Is a particular Twitter user a bot? This question has grown in particular importance especially in an age where misinformation can influence politics, beliefs, or endanger lives by providing false information. Of the three models that weâ€™ve developed to approach this problem, we found that the implementation of the Random Forest model on our summarized user data provided the best overall accuracy of 85% on our test data set.
