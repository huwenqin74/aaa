## Sentiment Analysis

Our work in creating bot-detection models helps distinguish between bots and non-bot Twitter users. Sentiment analysis of Twitter posts would be helpful in determining the opinion of those users and what opinions they are trying to convey. At the aggregate level, such information can help determine trends in how bots are trying to influence public discourse and opinion. This would be especially helpful in identifying large scale campaigns made by troll farms. Interference by the Russian firm, Internet Research Agency (IRA) on the United States Presidential Election could have been potentially detected, reported, and halted.

## Categorization of Bots

After detecting whether a Twitter user is a bot, it would be helpful to know what type of bot it is. There are many categories of bots, such as those who automatically tweet news updates, draw images, provide user support, and more. Such analysis can be helpful in distinguishing harmful bots which spread misinformation from bots that provide users with useful information such as [@EarthquakesSF](https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF) which tweets live earthquake information in the Bay area.

## Network Analysis

In a social platform such as Twitter, it would be interesting to analyze the interactions between users in the social network.  One such avenue, is the analysis of the users that are retweeting tweets.  Are bots retweeting a segment of tweets to promote an agenda or news story posted by people or bots? Can this abuse manipulate the social network and spread misinformation?
