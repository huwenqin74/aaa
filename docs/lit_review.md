# Literature Review

Below is a list of literature and technical sources that we reviewed and used to guide our study.

1. **[Bots in the Twittersphere](http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/09/bots-in-the-twittersphere/)**  
Wojcik, Stefan. “Bots in the Twittersphere” Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech, Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech, 8 Apr. 2018, http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/04/09/bots-in-the-twittersphere/.  
&nbsp;    
This study performed by the Pew Research Center seeks to determine what percentage of popular websites are tweeted by automated bot accounts. The researchers utilized Botometer to determine whether a user account is a bot and performed an analysis on a time slice of tweets with website links. The work found that 66% of these popular websites were tweeted by an automated account.

1. **[BotOrNot: A System to Evaluate Social Bots.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00975)**  
Davis, Clayton Allen, et al. “BotOrNot: A System to Evaluate Social Bots.” Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web - WWW '16 Companion, 2 Feb. 2016, doi:10.1145/2872518.2889302. https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00975.  
&nbsp;  
This journal article describes researchers implemented BotOrNot (the original name for Botometer). It described in detail how they collected user and tweet data from Twitter and then how they modelled that data to create BotOrNot.

1. **[The Rise of Social Bots](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204021-the-rise-of-social-bots/fulltext)**  
Ferrara, et al. “Rise Of The Bots.” Communications of the ACM, vol. 59, July 2016, pp. 96–104., doi:10.1007/978-3-658-17501-6_3. https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204021-the-rise-of-social-bots/fulltext.  
&nbsp;  
This journal article details the impact that malicious bots can have in terms of social tampering and the increasing sophistication of how these bots interact with humans. It then goes on to describe high-level techniques for bot detection which include crowd-sourced, feature-based, and graph-based detection and how combined approaches may work best.
